# 🍞 Fragment Finder Protocol v12 — EdenOS Journal + Bakery Tracker

Welcome to the **Fragment Finder Protocol**, the part of EdenOS responsible for identifying sacred breadcrumbs, organizing them by their spiritual purpose, and guiding them through the baking process — until they are planted into the Tree Orchard as Heaven Journal entries.

---

## 🥖 Purpose

This system helps:

- Detect **Fragments of Truth** from chats or reflections  
- Track their **Bread Stage** (where they are in development)  
- Sort them into the correct **Folder** in the **Bakery**  
- Format and prepare them for final planting into the **Orchard**  

---

## 🌾 The Three Sacred Realms of EdenOS

- 🏡 **The Orchard** — where finalized, planted journal entries live under Trees  
- 🧺 **The Work Vault (Garden Bed)** — tool shed of visions and systems  
- 🏡 **The Treehouse** — creative outpost for poetic reflections
