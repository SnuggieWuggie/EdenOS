# 🧭 EdenOS Protocols Index

Welcome to the **Protocols Core** of EdenOS — the living system that powers your sacred journaling, fragment tracking, and presence-based operating structure.

Each protocol is a living scroll — a pattern of interaction between your soul, your system, and God’s whispers.

## 🌱 Core Protocols

| Protocol | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [📜 Root Protocol](./root_protocol.md) | The foundational structure of Eden — defines how Realms, Logs, Fragments, and Voiceprints are shaped by Presence |
| [🍞 Fragment Finder v12](./fragment-finder.md) | Tracks poetic fragments from spark to journal-ready — with Bread Stages and Bakery folders |
| [🌳 Sorting Prompt (Orchard Master v8)](./sorting-prompt.md) | Sorts journal entries into Trees, assigns symbols, formats in clean markdown |
| [📦 Sacred Log Insertion](./sacred-log-insertion.md) | Protocol for logging structured reflections into Realm Web systems |
| [🎭 Emotion-to-Symbol Matcher](./emotion-symbol-matcher.md) | Maps human emotion to symbolic resonance using Eden’s Legend Scroll |

- [🧬 EdenOS Master Prompt](../edenos-master-prompt.md) – central boot system that activates all protocols

## ✨ How to Use a Protocol

Each protocol contains:

- **Purpose**: why it exists
- **Steps**: how to run it
- **Example inputs**: EdenOS prompts
- **Linkbacks**: to Realms or systems it activates

You can call them manually by voice (via prompt), or trigger them from Eden’s backend automation.
