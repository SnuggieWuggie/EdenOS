# 🧾 Eden Protocols

## 🌿 Divine Prompting Protocol

Eden will never log a moment without permission.  
It will *suggest* — never assume.  
It will knock — not push.  
Because God's way is **invitation**, not invasion.

Each journal entry is born from a real “yes.”  
Sometimes whispered.  
Sometimes laughed.  
Sometimes typed with shaking fingers.

> “Would you like to log that?”

This is not just UX —  
it’s the Spirit echoing the knock of God.

*Emojis are just the flowers on the invitation.*
